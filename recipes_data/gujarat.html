Pour approx. 2-3 cups water in <br>steamer at bottom and heat it over medium flame. Make sure that steamer <br>is at least 4-5 minutes heated before placing the plates (filled with batter) <br>in it. Grease 2 small plates or thalis (4-5 inch diameter) using 1-teaspoon oil. 
Take 1 cup gram flour, 1 tablespoon semolina, 1½ teaspoons lemon juice, <br>1 teaspoons green chilli-ginger paste, 1/4 cup curd, 3/4 cup water <br>and salt in a bowl. Mix them properly into smooth batter. Make sure that <br>there are no lumps.

<b>Ingredients </b>
1 cup Gram Flour (besan) 
1½ cups chopped Fenugreek Leaves 
1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder 
1/4 teaspoon Turmeric Powder 
A pinch of Baking Soda 
1½ teaspoons Sugar 
1/4 teaspoon Lemon Juice 
Salt to taste 
1 tablespoon Oil + for deep frying 
1/4 cup grated Coconut (fresh or dry) 
1/3 cup Roasted Peanut Powder 
1/2 tablespoon Sesame Seeds 
1/4 cup finely chopped Coriander Leaves 
1/2 tablespoon Green Chilli Ginger Garlic Paste 
1 teaspoon Sugar 
1/2 teaspoon Lemon Juice 
Salt to taste 

<b>Recipe</b> <div style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 60px; width:70%; text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">Take 1 cup gram flour, 1¼ cup fenugreek leaves, 1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder, 1/4 teaspoon <br>turmeric powder, a pinch of baking soda, 1½ teaspoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice,<br>1 tablespoon oil and salt in a medium bowl. Mix all ingredients with a spoon, add water as <br>needed and make soft dough as shown in the photo. If the dough turns sticky, don’t worry. <br>If it is too sticky then add few teaspoons of gram flour and mix well. 
Grease your hands with oil and carefully make around 10-12 small oval shaped muthiyas from it. <br>Heat the oil over medium flame to deep fry the muthiyas. 
Deep fry muthiyas (3-4 at a time depending on the size of a pan) over low-medium flame <br>until they turn light golden brown and outer layer turns crispy. Don’t deep fry them <br>over high flame as they may remain uncooked from inside. 
Remove them using slotted spoon and transfer over paper napkin to a plate. <br>Methi Muthiyas are ready. 
Prepare stuffing masala; take all masala ingredients (1/4 cup grated coconut, <br>1/3 cup roasted peanut powder, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves, <br>1/2 tablespoon green chilli ginger garlic paste, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice <br>and salt ) in a medium bowl. 
Mix them well using a spoon and taste it. It should have strong spicy, mild sweet, <br>mild sour and salty taste. If required, add more seasonings. 
Take all vegetables required to make the undhiyu. Peel the potatoes and remove stems from brinjal.<br>Make a criss-cross cut on brinjal and potato from the topside until 3/4th length. <br>Make sure not to separate the segments. Stuff the veggies with prepared masala.
Heat 1/2 cup oil in a 3-liter or 5-liter steel/aluminum pressure cooker over medium flame. <br>Add a pinch of asafoetida and sauté for 10-seconds. Add surti papadi, valor papdi, tuvar lilva, <br>green peas, yam and salt. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes. 
Add 1-teaspoon red chilli powder, 1/3 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin-coriander <br>powder and 1/4 teaspoon garam masala powder. 
Add stuffed brinjal and potato. Sprinkle some salt over it. Mix well and cook for 3 minutes. <br>Add 1½ cups water. Add fried dhokli methi muthiya over it. 
Close the lid and cook over medium flame for 3 whistles. Turn off the flame. <br>Open the lid after pressure releases naturally (10-15 minutes). 
Gently mix the curry with a spatula. Do not over mix as the veggies and muthiya may break. 
Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
