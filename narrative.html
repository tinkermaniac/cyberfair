                <p>The word curry is used to describe a gravy or a sauce in a dish in India. Curries have their own names denoting the presence of sauce including various spices and herbs. While Indians often prepare their own curry pastes to shorten daily cookery, these curries 
                  are absolutely recipe specific not generic pastes.

                  vahchak, who recite the Hindu religious texts, such as the Puranas, Ramayana and Bhagavata Gita. Such events take place in Indian households when it involves 
                  smaller stories related to the fasting (Vrat). For example, the Shri Satyanarayan Katha, Ramayan Katha are didactic in nature and used to instill moral values.

                <p>Good food is the foundation of genuine happiness. - Auguste Escoffier  

                  Food makes one happy! 
                  
                  Food has always brought people together irrespective of their varied ethnic backgrounds. In India, people are fond of eating a variety of food items. 
                  
                  Food everywhere has a different flavour and authenticity. Take a tour around the country and you will find an exotic yet different flavour and taste at every corner. 
                  
                  There is definitely some interesting story or reason behind the existence of every curry and cuisine. 
                  
                  This gives rise to the question, HOW? 
                  
                  For this reason, we have chosen the topic, CURRYKATHA- The Lost Recipes!  
                  
                  And to let you know about our varied curry specialities we would like to invite you to our Curry Katha!

                <p>Our community is such, that it reflects on our cultural richness. We continue to respect, and follow the ideals and traditions that our ancestors left behind. And that, of course, also includes the traditional methods and recipes to cook the healthiest and most sumptuous meals the world has to offer; and that, combined by the qualities of kindness and care are what make our character powerful. The combination of an appetizing and nutritious diet with a pinch of compassion, diligence and love for our culture, is what gives us energy to preserve our tradition and pass it on to posterity. Our community perseveres, in unity, to bring the targeted goals to fruition, be it toiling for the day of harvest, or helping the ones in need. Our visits to Hotel Vivanta, and to the village of Tigaon are evident descriptions 
                  of a nutritionally balanced, united, and kind community.

                <p>Curry Katha is a depiction of an Indian society that perseveres to make the most delectable curries. ‘Katha’ here, is a Hindi word, whose literal meaning is- story. A great emphasis has been laid on the lifestyle of the common civilians filled with love, who live in the countryside and follow the traditional ways of cooking and living. The title symbolizes the significance of curry in uniting communities beyond the horizon in India, it shows the story of how curry reaches one’s table at different 
                  places and how diverse a food item such as curry can be.

                <h4 class="card-title">Theme of the project</h4>
                <p>Establishing unity among communities across a diverse country such as India requires a common ground; and this common ground, was, with no doubt, curries. No matter what part of the nation we belong to, curry is a staple for all. 
                  The title “Curries of India - the lost delicacies” is a self-explanatory title. Yes, curries are an important part of our culture, but some of them, unfortunately, got lost along the way. But, they are only forgotten- not gone; some kind souls continue to serve these curries to their families, and to the poor, with the spirit to keep them alive. And our goal, with this project, was to make a difference- to make not only Indians, but also the world aware of these delicacies once again. The agenda of our project has been to showcase this connection between curries and our true selves, and, is also an effort towards bring back to life this lost endeavour that play a huge role in strengthening this unity and inciting enthusiasm in world 
                  citizens whenever they hear about Indian cuisine.

                <p>International Cyber Fair is an authentic learning program utilized by schools and youth organizations around the world for students to help them in developing new skills and interests. The main research we did for this Cyber Fair project was on World Hunger and how India helps in this problem. World Hunger refers to the situation in which a large number of people are starving or not getting enough nutrients. India helped the world a lot by sending other countries food assistance such as wheat and other substances. India started many revolutions to help with the food supplies such as green revolution, the white revolution and many schemes and helped many people such as Mid-Day Meal and National Food Security Act. 

                  This research helped us in learning many new things and, made us aware of things going on around the world I learned many new facts about World Hunger and out government’s acts towards it. And, the internet of course has been a great help for our research. For teaching and learning too, it has been more effective than the traditional methods, because provides students with the opportunities they require for evaluation since every child has a different method of learning.

                <p>The Cyber Fair project wouldn't have been the same without the use of information tools and technologies. Everyone had a computer and access to the Internet which facilitated research. Some students also collected content from the books available in the school library. They coordinated and collaborated with each other through calls, 
                  texts and video conferencing platforms. We also had the opportunity to visit the well-known 5 Star hotel, Taj Vivanta and also explore the Indian cuisine in Tigaon. There, we interviewed many renowned chefs and people who enhanced our knowledge about the uniqueness and diversity of Indian food. We also clicked pictures and made videos 
                  of our progress, visits, interviews and much more. These valuable tools certainly helped us immensely in the project. We not only had easy access to content and information but also, we were able to communicate with each other easily and keep track of our progress. The advancement of IT and the use of Internet facilitated our work to a great extent. In our school as well, we worked in the computer lab with computers having easy Internet access. Team work, coordination and determination helped us the most and guided us throughout the project.

                <p>“We ought always to try to influence others for good.”-L. M. Montgomery
                  Constant striving for better are essential in order to make a positive impact on society. And of course, this striving wouldn’t alone make much of a difference- what we need, is knowledge, hard work, and to spread awareness in all parts of the society. 
                  Throughout this project, as we, the students worked on our assignments, we had in us, will, commitment and determination. Our topic, as you may already know, was curries- local curries, that reflect the rich past and flavors of our much diverse nation. But, unfortunately, some of these delicacies got lost somewhere on the way, and today, most people in urban areas, busy in their hectic lives, never make an effort as to conserve these long-standing. 
                  So, as to make a difference, the students went on to visit those who know- chefs of a very well-known hotel, and the locals of a village not far. Through these trips, not only did the we, as students, learn a lot, but also set an example for others.
                  The students of Aravali International School seemed to have made an impact several ways- those visits being one of them. We volunteered to invest our time and resources to help those in need, such as feeding the poor in need. Other than that, some students took a step forward and also helped the stray animals who were deprived of food and shelter.
                  Looking at it from another point of view, we also acted as representatives of the younger people, and showed the people around them, that by hard work, change is eminent, and that the will to bring a change for good is still alive in younger generation.

                <p>Through this project, in order enhance our knowledge, we made visits to those who had real knowledge of the subject- one to Hotel Taj 
                  Vivanta, and the other to the Tiguan village, that lies close to the outskirts of the city. The chefs at Hotel Vivanta, were with no doubt a 
                  great help. They gave answers to all curious minds that went there- from the origin of the curry to the spices that go into its making. But the 
                  part of the project that seemed to have taken all the spotlight was the visit to the Tiguan village. As the trip was being planned, one of the students seized the opportunity, and started working on putting his idea on paper, to share his knowledge with the locals while he would be there. The idea here, was to make the villagers, most of whom were farmers, aware of the issues that they may be facing, but might not really be aware of. One of the issues raised in this discussion was how they might be a victim internal theft. Internal theft on farms is a serious issue that can lead to significant financial losses for farmers. He also went on to suggest some measures that they can take in order to avoid such malpractices from taking place in the future. As the discussion unfold, we also got familiar with the farmers’ conventional agricultural practices. So, putting our knowledge to use, we made them aware of some modern agricultural practices, which will not only be cost efficient but also save time and efforts. The locals were not only impressed by our knowledge, but also thankful to our team for the efforts. Though this may not be too much, the students were happy to at least have made and effort.

                <p>International Cyber Fair is an authentic learning program utilized by schools and youth organizations around the world for students to help them in developing new skills and interests. The main research we did for this Cyber Fair project was on World Hunger and how India helps in this problem. 
                  World Hunger refers to the situation in which a large number of people are starving or not getting enough nutrients. India helped the world a lot by sending other countries food assistance such as wheat and other substances. India started many revolutions to help with the food supplies such as 
                  green revolution, white revolution and many schemes and helped many people such as Mid-Day Meal and National Food Security Act. These researches helped us in learning many new things and, made us aware about things going around the world and I learned many new facts about World Hunger and out 
                  government acts towards it. And, the internet of course has been a great help for our research. For teaching and learning too, it has been more effective than the traditional methods, because provides students the opportunities they require for evaluation, since every child has a different method of learning.

                  This project was a complete learning package for us.  
                  
                  From gaining a sense of accomplishment while working in a kitchen to making healthy choices. We learned about spices originating from India while sharing a good conversation. 
                  
                  Basic Math, Science and language skills were an integral part of this project. We learned the history behind the  Indian curries as well.
