    <span class="manipur">MANIPUR</span>
    <h3>Manipuri cuisine reflects the geographical, social and cultural specialities of the North-Eastern part of India. This region has a close connection with the nature, which is well-seen in their way of cooking. With a mix of flavours ranging from plain to pleasant, Manipuri food is an extreme delight to the taste buds. 
 
        Vegetables are mostly grown at home or bought from the local market. As a result of this, the ingredients are fresh and the dishes are seasonal. The common vegetables that are commonly found here include pumpkins, various kinds of beans, gourds, brinjals, etc.  
        Apart from this, vegetables like yendem (a kind of taro), kolamni (water spinach), thangjing (foxnut), koukhaa (katniss), yongchak (a variety of bitter beans), sougri (roselle leaves), ngari (a fermented and dried fish) are an important source of a major portion of the food cooked in this place.
