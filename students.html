                <p>A school always ensures the best learning experience for the students. The team of Aravali International School unites day and night to propagate learning and life skill development. Inspired by the performance of the students in previous year in Cyber Fair, most of the students of our school were filled with zest and optimism to participate in this event. I am fortunate enough to be able to be a part of this occurrence. The student’s initiative and continuous guidance from the teachers and school authorities enable the execution of project. To me, this project means a heap of knowledge and experience that is to be gained while researching, experimenting, and analyzing. With the passage of time and the influence of western culture, the youth of India often tend to forget about the significance of authentic, traditional, and appetizing Indian curries. Creating a project around the importance of this subject not only enhances the thinking and creativity skills of youth but creates an immense impact in social and cultural well-being. Involving myself in a project so rich has helped me in unique ways to develop my abilities. I hope I continue to be an asset to this project and gain a considerable amount of knowledge through it.

I learned many skills that I was unaware of earlier, and my web-development skills improved a whole lot. I learned bootstrap and had an extension in my CSS skills, it was fun playing with the functionalities of the JS and producing results worthy of platinum, the feeling of working as a corporate member, under the supervision of my dear teachers was exquisite. I wish to be a part of the esteemed columns of the Aravalli Cyber-fair crew next year and in years to come

                <p>I am Harini Arunkumar from Grade – IX. This year I was lucky to be a part of Cyber Fair again. This time too I had a marvelous experience, exploring the uniqueness and diversity of Indian food which attracts Indians as well as people from other countries. I also got an amazing opportunity to visit the renowned 5 Star hotel, Taj Vivanta where the chefs demonstrated the preparation of mouth- watering and delicious authentic dishes. I enjoyed researching, collaborating and contributing towards this year's project with my teammates, as one. The most important aspect is that I realised the outstanding nature of India's rich cuisine, culture and heritage which we all must be proud of. I will be thankful and grateful to my teachers for giving me yet another fantastic opportunity and trusting me to lead the team. Overall, it was an enlightening and spectacular experience.

This year, I was chosen as a part of the Cyber Fair team as a member of the technical team in the project. Apart from python and HTML, I learned something new during this project- photography and videography. I got a chance to film the moments with the chefs of ‘Vivanta by Taj’ and got to know more about the scrumptious Indian curries. It was a great opportunity to be part of the Cyber Fair team at an international level. Lastly, I would like to thank all the teachers and participants for being our mentors.    </a>

                <p> It was a great opportunity for me to be a part of the Cyber Fair team.  

                  We had worked with our community members and learned many things many new things from them. 
                  
                  All my fellow team mates were cooperative and I felt very comfortable with them. We learned through experiential learning in the team & we were glad to push our juniors to a better experience of cyber fair. I would definitely like to join this project again.

                <p>I am Balkirat Singh of Grade IX from Aravali International School- Sector 43. This year, I got the golden opportunity to participate in Cyber fair. I also wanted to enroll in this project and try to improve my research and graphic skills. As it was my first time, I had a great experience with all the teachers and students. 

                  We were divided into various teams and I was a part of the content team. Firstly, I went through the topic, researched about it and commenced with writing on my own. I also made the video of how to make curries especially for Shahi Paneer, an Indian authentic curry from Punjab.  
                  
                  At last, I would like to say that it was not a bed of roses for all the participants. Everyone worked hard and will surely be able to open the doors of success.

                <p> I got the opportunity to participate in this project. It was a great chance to contribute and learn new stuff. 

                  I was a part of the content team and it required me to gather information from various sources, create logo etc. Research turned out to be very informative, and it was a great learning experience for me. I was given the task to design a logo for our website, and I learnt few designing concepts as well. Overall, CyberFair gave me good exposure and it helped me to acquire new skills.</p>

The people were so kind, so generous and positive which makes me happy whenever I remember the visit. All the community members treated us like family. Not only the visits but the food was also great. I also enjoyed the pottery session during our visit to the community. 

                  These positive vibes were enough for me. It was a wonderful experience. Hoping to get  such more opportunities </p>

                <p>I have loved working for Cyberfair. I gained a lot of knowledge and have explored new things. Different people with different perspectives may not always agree with one another but everyone worked professionally and co-operated with each other. I also made sure that teachers and my group members were happy with my work. We worked effectively as a team. We met at regular intervals to discuss our progress. I have also learned new things from my group members which will help in my future projects. By doing this project, I got a lot of information about the heritage and culture of our nation. 

                  I also got to see the greenery of villages and got to know the food habits of local community members and villages of India. I am proud that I could do such a big project and that too with such confidence and courage. At last, I would like to thank my dear teachers for trusting me for this project. I am extremely happy to be a part of it.    </a>

                <p> This is my third year participating in the Cyber fair and it indeed added a lot of value to my skill set. The topics chosen are very relevant in the current scenario. The research undertaken by the team members was very comprehensive and helps us gain a deep insight into it. I got to learn about the various types of food, its flavours, its production, marketing, distribution, and everything related was covered in detail and was a new learning for me. I always look forward to learning about new topics and enjoy researching on the same by reading various resources including books and internet. 

                  Indian food has taken over the world by a rave. I feel very proud of our rich culinary heritage, our spices, the aroma and flavours that attract the world towards India.I look forward to participating in the cyber fair every year and enhance my knowledge in different walks of life. I am very thankful to Anjilin ma’am and my team members who made this learning experience a remarkable one by giving me this opportunity.

                <p> Despite of all challenges, working for CyberFair was fantastic and successful this year. We visited many places in our locality where we met different kind of chefs. We visited villages where we met the local people. We experienced the taste of the food. We asked them many questions and made videos to display in our website.As I was a part of content team we learned about many things which we were not aware of.  

                  We did a great teamwork. We hope that are teamwork shows a good achievement as we have given are best efforts. Our whole team made logos and templates which will be displayed in our website. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and we learned many things which we were not aware of.  </p>

                <p> Participating in CyberFair was a great experience for me as I worked with different team members and led research work around Indian Curry Evolution and history around the same. In the process, I learnt how to contribute in a team toward attaining a common goal. While doing the research work, I was surprised to know that how rich our culture has been in terms of our culinary and Indian food evolution which has gone through major shifts from generations yet maintaining its original essence. 

                  Thanks for giving me such an opportunity and I would be looking forward for such projects in times to come as well.   </p>

                <p> A school always ensures the best learning experience for the students. The team of Aravali International School unites day and night to propagate learning and life skill development. Inspired by the performance of the students in previous year in Cyber Fair, most of the students of our school were filled with zest and optimism to participate in this event. I am fortunate enough to be able to be a part of this occurrence. The student’s initiative and continuous guidance from the teachers and school authorities enable the execution of project.  

                  To me, this project means a heap of knowledge and experience that is to be gained while researching, experimenting, and analyzing. With the passage of time and the influence of western culture, the youth of India often tend to forget about the significance of authentic, traditional, and appetizing Indian curries. Creating a project around the importance of this subject not only enhances the thinking and creativity skills of youth but creates an immense impact in social and cultural well-being. 
                  
                  Involving myself in a project so rich has helped me in unique ways to develop my abilities. I hope I continue to be an asset to this project and gain a considerable amount of knowledge through it.  </a>

                <p> This is Riddhi Khandelwal, and I am a student of Grade 9 from Aravalli International School. I'm a member of content, creative and interview team. When I first got to know about my participation, it felt as if I was on cloud nine, it was the excitement of trying something new and spreading awareness. Even more, when we came up with the Theme of “Curry Katha”, it was the fact that we got the opportunity to enlighten on our country's extensive history and its relishing flavours.  

                  India has vast geographical features, which blesses us with all kinds of textures and it all sums in our richly heart filled food. Heading out the teams was also a gratification, all the members had their own colourful portfolio but working together every day, days in school, nights in zoom meetings we all made it work out and turned it in a beautiful art, wait no, an amazing dish. I also got to notice hand in hand the traditional practices of India for making a curry, the words of wisdom of the people living in village. I found their hospitality quite warm and pleasant. And I’m dearly thankful to Anjlin ma’am and Richa ma’am for their continued support and help. I’m more than ever pleased for them to put in their trust in me. I got to learn so much from this, not only was I able to comprehend the struggles of the team but getting over it as well.  
                  
                  The research process was the most interesting to me, we went through places to places, books to books and then library to library to get that book, it was indeed a learning opportunity now that I can proudly say I’m the member of the young generation who is well aware of its country food originality and impact. In the end, not only did I get to know that it was the Portuguese that bought chilli to India but also that India bought flavour to the world.
